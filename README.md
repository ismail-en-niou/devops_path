## How to Run and Work with Server Performance Script

1. **Navigate to the script folder**:
    ```bash
    cd "Server Performance stat"
    ```

2. **Install dependencies** (if required):
    ```bash
    # Example for Bash scripts (no installation needed for basic usage)
    # If your script requires additional tools, install them as needed
    sudo apt-get install sysstat
    ```

3. **Run the server performance script**:
    ```bash
    bash server_performance.sh
    ```

4. **Configure script options**:
    - Edit the script to set server details or monitoring intervals.
    - Use command-line arguments if supported:
      ```bash
      bash server_performance.sh --server 192.168.1.100 --interval 60
      ```

5. **View results**:
    - Output will be displayed in the terminal or saved to a log file (check script documentation).
    - Review metrics such as CPU, memory, and disk usage.

6. **Troubleshooting**:
    - Ensure all required tools are installed (e.g., `sysstat`, `top`, `vmstat`).
    - Check script permissions:
      ```bash
      chmod +x server_performance.sh
      ```
    - Review log files or terminal output for errors.

For more details, refer to the script's inline comments or the [docs](./docs) folder.
